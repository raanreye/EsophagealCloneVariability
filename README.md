# EsophagealCloneVariability

## Overview
This repository hosts the computational code, analysis scripts, and detailed documentation for the research paper "Non-genetic differences underlie variability in proliferation among esophageal epithelial clones." Each experiment conducted in our study is assigned a unique identifier (ID), which is used to organize and reference the corresponding data stored in a dedicated Google Drive folder.

## Experiment IDs
Each experiment within our study is uniquely identified by an ID with the format `RARXXX`, where `XXX` is a sequential number starting from 001. These IDs are crucial for locating the related datasets on Google Drive and understanding the data processing and analysis steps outlined in the code.

Example IDs:
- RAR001
- RAR002
- RAR003
- ...

## Accessing Data
To access the experimental data associated with each ID:
1. Navigate to the designated Google Drive folder (link provided below).
2. Locate the folder corresponding to the experiment ID of interest (e.g., RAR001 for the first experiment).
3. Inside each folder, you will find the raw data, processed data, and any supplementary materials relevant to the experiment.

## Repository Structure
This section details the organization of the repository, including the location of scripts, notebooks, and documentation for each experiment.

- `/code`: Contains all computational code and scripts used for data processing and analysis. Scripts are organized by experiment ID for ease of reference.
- `/docs`: Includes detailed documentation, method descriptions, and additional notes about the experiments and analyses.
- `/results`: Houses the output files, including figures and result summaries, generated by the analysis scripts.

## Usage Instructions
To replicate the analyses or explore the data:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required computational environment and dependencies installed (listed in `requirements.txt`).
3. Download the relevant datasets from the Google Drive as per the instructions in the "Accessing Data" section.
4. Run the scripts in the `/code` directory corresponding to the experiment ID you are interested in. Detailed usage instructions for each script are provided within the script files themselves.
